    "**1. 1. Select a statement from the list below that is correct for the Inverse Transform Sampling (ITS) method** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The ITS method is based on a theorem. The theorem is presented in the notebook [09_distribution_sampling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a5QgVXSDrMqnAMGOke-C6RwGFW13undD/view?usp=sharing)\n",

    "\n",
    "**2.  What is the the key requirement for using Inverse Transform Sampling method to draw random numbers from a given distribution?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Cumulative distribution function should be invertable\n",
    "\n",
    "The other options are either not correct. Cumulative distribution function should be monotonic is correct, but it is monotonic always (by definition), so this is not a relevant condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why in practice we need to sample log of the distribution, not the distribution itself?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: This is needed to avoid numerical underflow in areas where distribution amplitude is extremely small\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC does not work faster with the logarithm and does not strictly require using logarithm. With some care for certain distributions sampling can be done without using the logarithm. However, in general without using logarithm roundoff underflow errors in the areas of very small values of distribution cause severe problems and often prevent sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What can we do to minimize the length of the burn-in sequence?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Choose starting location closer to the maximum of the sampled distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start close to the maximum of the distribution initial samples are much more typical samples of the distribution and so burn-in length is essentially zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. The trace plots of a variable sampled by MCMC can be used to** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "* To estimate the length of the burn-in sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "* To roughly estimate the auto-correlation time of the MCMC chain\n",
    "\n",
    "* To gauge convergence of the MCMC chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicate samples are not visible in the trace plot so they cannot be identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is measured by the auto-correlation time?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The typical number of steps over which samples in the chain are significantly correlated\n",
    "\n",
    "The other options are blatantly incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "**7. If I have MCMC chain for a parameter x of length 10000 and estimate of the auto-correlation time for this chain is 100. How many truly independent samples do I have in the chain approximately?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The number of independent samples is approximately equal to the length of the chain divided by the auto-correlation time (average width of peaks and valleys in the trace plot): so here it is ~10000/100~100.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What can we expect if MCMC chain is not well converged? (Check all that applies)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Distribution is not well sampled and samples are not useable for statistical analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distribution may be well sampled along some dimensions, but not along others\n",
    "\n",
    "* Auto-correlation time estimate may be unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. This question is for graduate students only: What kind of matrix decomposition is used to produce correlated random numbers?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Cholesky decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. This question is for graduate students only: when we deal with a covariance matrix C that is used to draw correlated random numbers what are the key requirements for the properties of C?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: It should be positive definite\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. This question is for graduate students: How is convergence quantified in the Gelman-Rubin convergence indicator?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Average variance within multiple parallel chains divided by the variance of last samples in the chains is close to 1 within specified threshold\n",
