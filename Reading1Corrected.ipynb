    "**1. Why the error affecting numerical schemes, such as schemes for numerically solving motion of gravitationally interacting particles, is called truncation error? Check all that applies.** \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Because numerical schemes neglect (truncates) terms in the Taylor expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because numerical schemes approximate mathematical derivative with an approximation that involves finite differences\n",

    "The last item:\n",
    "\"Because numerical calculations are limited by a limited number of bits used to represent floating point numbers\"\n",
    "\n",

    "* There is no difference between such schemes in practice\n",

    "* Accuracy of the overall integration after many steps scales as delta t squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is the last item, because it is the accuracy after N steps that determines the order of accuracy of the sheme. The leading terms truncated by the 1st order scheme is actually O((x-x0)^2), while for the 2nd scheme it is O((x-x0)^3). \n",
