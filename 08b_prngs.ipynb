    "\n",
    "1. \"random xorshift\" operation. This operation uses the three highest (leftmost) bits of the number to choose by how many bits to shift to the right. The three upper bits if they are random will produce random integer numbers from 0 to 7. This is a bit too small - the number of lower non-random bits in LCG can be larger than this. So we add 4 to the number given by the three upper bits to make resulting random number to vary from 4 to 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The original LCG number is then bit-shifted to the right by this random number: i.e. we are dropping a random number (from 4 to 11) of lower bits of the LCG number, which usually show the worst irregularities. The remaining bits should be pretty random. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The random number from step 2 is xor'ed with the original LCG number. Note that the right shift in step 2 created a random number of zeros in the upper bits of the resulting number. So xor'ing original LCG number with those zeros will retain the upper bits of the original number, which are almost always very random (for good choices of $a$ and $m$). \n",
    "Lower bits of the shifted number should be pretty random after the shift, because they are a random subset of the original upper bits of the LCG number. Xor'ing these random bits with lower bits of the original LCG number will randomize them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If this was not enough, the algorithm multiplies the result of step 3 by a large odd integer number to create a random number with more non-zero bits. Then it drops lowest bits of the result by shifting it by 22 bits to the right and then xor's the result with the result of step 3 again in the second cycle of randomizing the lowest bits. "
