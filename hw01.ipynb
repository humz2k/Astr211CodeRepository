Run simulations using integration with the 1st order Euler and 2nd order leapfrog. An example of how this problem can be initialized  is provided in 01_orbit_integration. Follow evolution for several tens of orbits (up to ~100) and make sure that at least for the leapfrog scheme the orbit stays circular during integration.  \n","\n","Specifically, plot distance of the Earth from the origin $x, y, z = 0, 0, 0$ as a function of time for the 1st order Euler and KD  schemes. How do results for these schemes compare for a given step size? How do results depend on step size? Try several different step sizes.  Do results change/improve if you decrease step size significantly? Which step size you would be confident to use for the actual calculations of planet orbits?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ecEmrOIislLE"},"source":["#### Additional info and hints: \n","The evolution code should consist of a loop stepping in time.\n","For each particle acceleration is computed by direct summation of forces from all other particles and use it to advance positions of particles. Thus, to compute acceleration of all particles one has to have two loops over particles (which is what makes this problem scale as $N^2$). \n","\n","\n","**Note:** Use of Python classes is useful for this problem. If you feel comfortable with using classes I encourage you to try their use for this problem.  If you want to go this route, I'll be happy to provide guidance, if needed.  \n","\n","**Note:** The second loop during step can be done via NumPy operation without an explicit loop. With some effort both loops in computation of accelerations for all $N$ particles can be replaced with NumPy operations. I encourage you to try to do try getting rid of the second or both loops using NumPy operations. If you will be able to avoid using inner loop using NumPy operation you will receive ***3 extra-credit points*** and if you will be able to avoid both you will get ***6 extra-credit points.*** Attempt this only after you get code working with a function computing accelerations using loops.
